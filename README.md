- ✨ Welcome, my friend
- 🌱 I’m an undergraduate student pursuing a bachelor's degree of Information Security at Nankai University.
- 👨‍💻 I'm currently working as a Research Assistant in [Tsinghua University, BNRIST, Beijing](https://www.bnrist.tsinghua.edu.cn/bnristen/).
- 💞️ I’m also a big fun of films and TV series, hoping to write a movie script by myself one day.
- 🔭 I hold dreams of a master degree of Computer Science in the US and a stage with more possibilities.

My research focus mainly on multimodal and federated learning. If you got any insights into related fields, just reach me via [email](ErwinZhou@outlook.com), let's build something together.
